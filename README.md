# leetcode - notes
### 1. dps/backtracking with memorization could only be used on bottom-up manner.
* If we try to use a up to bottom manner, it's hard to implement memorization.
* BFS is also hard to use with memorization because it's hard to know some true result before all branches reach the end.
* But we can cut some visited branches in BFS.
* Example: 140. Word Break II, 1066. Campus Bikes II
   
### 2. For dynamic programming, please not only consider look back but also consider look forward
* Example: 403. Frog Jump.

### 3. For tree - related problem please consider divide it to sub-trees
* Use DFS but not BFS to solve sub-tree problems. Please realize that root.left and root.right is the same tree as root.
* We can apply the same function to all sub-trees because they are all the same.
* Exampleï¼š545. Boundary of Binary Tree.

### 4. For problems about game theory
* Use BFS to traverse all possible conditions step by step
* Sometimes we can start from the must win result and traverse back to find all must win startting conditions. 
* Example: 913. Cat and Mouse

### 5. For Parser Problem
* There is a modularized solution using dfs
* Example: 736. Parse Lisp Expression, 1096. Brace Expansion II

### 6. For Problems about Sliding Window or Two Pointers
* [Reference Discussion](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/discuss/92007/sliding-window-algorithm-template-to-solve-all-the-leetcode-substring-search-problem)
